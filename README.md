# CS455Project1
Read in a target image and then encrypt using 4 different encryption algorithms.

Verified to work with Java 1.8.

```bash
javac src/Foley.java
```

Will run and put text files of the cipher in docs/, along with a recording of times per algorithms, and put the encrypted
cipher images in the img/ folder.
